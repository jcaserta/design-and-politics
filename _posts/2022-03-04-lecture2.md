The British would have cotton grown in India, then have it picked by Indians, put on ships, shipped to England, where it would be spun into thread, woven into cloth, shipped back to India and sold to the Indian people for a higher price. In fact, Britain had laws that forced the Indians to buy only this cloth. Gandhi thought “Why should we have to buy back our own cotton cloth? Let’s spin it ourselves!” So he learned how to spin and weave cotton into cloth. He and his followers taught this old fashioned way of spinning and weaving to thousands of others.

“It is one of those cruel ambiguities. For some it means something good, for others it means something abhorrent. … The symbol, whatever you call it, swastika or hooked-cross, has become adopted and co-opted as a symbol of racial and ethnic prejudice and white superiority. … I am convinced for Americans and Europeans it must be maintained as a taboo sign.”
