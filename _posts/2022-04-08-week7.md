Harvard Design Magazine's issue on Publics is scanned by article and [viewable here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TO68onmzshzOJujMNQm9qtWPrQFd-lC1?usp=sharing). It includes articles on equity, protest, etc. Particularly impactful is this interview with Walter Hood asking ["How can we share space together."](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1TO68onmzshzOJujMNQm9qtWPrQFd-lC1)

## Method activity: Extremism/Sliders

![Slider](/img/slider2.png)

For our third method activity, you will work with the form of the slider bar. Slider bars have a range between a minimum and a maximum. Create a minimum of 20 slider bars for various scenarios. Define the minimum and maximum as a way to stretch how we think about those scenarios. 

Show us results from your slider bar activity as a way of stretching your conception about what you can do in your site. 

[Put your slider bars on this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOCtRucU=/?invite_link_id=944439351970)
