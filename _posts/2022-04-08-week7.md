## Public space check-in

##### 2:10


Assembled in a group of three, discuss the locaion you've chosen for your public space project and get feedback from your classmates. Drop images of your site in the #unit-3 channel in Slack for John to see. 

#### Reading/Reference

* Harvard Design Magazine's issue on Publics is scanned by article and [viewable here](https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TO68onmzshzOJujMNQm9qtWPrQFd-lC1?usp=sharing). It includes articles on equity, protest, etc. Particularly impactful is this interview with Walter Hood asking ["How can we share space together."](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1TO68onmzshzOJujMNQm9qtWPrQFd-lC1)


#### Method activity: Extremism/Sliders

For next week, work with the form of the slider bar. Slider bars have a range between a minimum and a maximum. Create a minimum of 20 slider bars for various scenarios. Define the minimum and maximum as a way to stretch how we think about those scenarios. 

Show us results from your slider bar activity as a way of stretching your conception about what you can do in your site. 

[Put your slider bars on this Miro board](https://miro.com/app/board/uXjVOCtRucU=/?invite_link_id=944439351970)


## Outdoor activity

![Arrow made from moss](/img/arrow.jpg)

We'll venture out to two contiguious public parks: Mary Elizabeth Sharpe, which occupies two house plots between Benefit and Pratt Streets, and Prospect Terrace Park, which abutts ME Sharpe. 

You'll work in groups of three. As a means of investing and participating in public space, make a short-term alteration to the park. Use what you find, and reconfigure it to communicate with other visitors.
