We'll meet up with State Representative Leonela Felix. Felix entered the state house in 2020, beating a former cop in a predominantly white elderly district in Pawtucket. Felix will talk about her current legislation that involves prison reform; as well as taxing RISD and Brown. She'll give us an image of what the job looks like. We'll take an extensive tour of the building.
