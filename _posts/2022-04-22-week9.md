Weâ€™ll visit with Greg Victor, head of the friends group at [Peace & Plenty Park](https://www.google.com/maps/place/Peace+%26+Plenty+Park/@41.8064313,-71.4250896,17z/data=!3m1!4b1!4m6!3m5!1s0x89e4457c1ad01cd1:0x6f00992ad73e0b7e!8m2!3d41.8064273!4d-71.4228956!15sCgEqkgEEcGFyaw?shorturl=1), on the southside of Providence. Greg worked for years to secure land for a park and has cultivated people and plants alike at the community garden across the street. [Through a City Council ordinance](https://council.providenceri.gov/2021/07/22/green-and-complete-streets-ordinance/), streets are changing to become more pedestrian friendly. Greg Victor will take us on a walk to see these changes.
