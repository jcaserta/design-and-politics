[Through a City Council ordinance](https://council.providenceri.gov/2021/07/22/green-and-complete-streets-ordinance/), streets have changed to become more pedestrian friendly. Greg Victor will take us on a walk to see these changes.

## DWRI Letterpress

##### 5:00

If we have time, we'll stop into [DWRI Letterpress](https://g.page/DWRILetterpress?share) and see their political printing work. Wear your mask!





## Public Projects

I'll check in with you about your public projects, and if time, we'll sit outside or back in the classroom to discuss progress. Next week we will have half the class dedicated to looking at these. Keep progressing on a project for public space or an open inquiry project.
