# Who's in charge?

Consciousness around who owns a company, where products are made, environmental impacts. Collectives. In addition to 

>>"Having a politically engaged practice isn't about just making a political poster, but the way we work together. How we do the work as what. If we want to enable radical change, we need to question it in our own life and work." —Gemma Copeland

>>“All of us have a sphere of influence, a community within reach, that we can labor inside and help transition.” - Valerie Kaur

Flat pay structure. 
Worker coops, democratically owned.

##### Week 1

#### Activity: To what groups do you belong…

Working at a table with two or three classmates, make a list or diagram of what groups you belong to.
*15min*
<!-- 2017 doc [Add to this Doc](https://docs.google.com/document/d/1OAJ9aUnOGOpoQdGYAhQdMmB9MGnQWZS3hA7caDqpt0s/edit?usp=sharing)
-->

Share with your table. Start to unpack how those groups organize themselves? How is in charge? What are the rules? How do rules change?
*15–30min*

Share with the class what you learned, which group lends itself to further study for next week? Why?
*45min*

#### For next week

Design an 'org chart' for one of the groups generated in class. 

* Each of the following makes use of various  principles: representatives, voting, decentralized labor, etc. Make a diagram, physical visulization or other that communicates how the group organizes itself. What are the benefits and drawbacks to its structure? What are the rules? Who has a stake? What makes it special? How can we learn from it?  

Your chart may make clear hierarchies, decision flows. Consider the form of the chart as it helps to reinforce the ideas you hope to convey. 

* Read: CapsLock
