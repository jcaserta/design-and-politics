#### Organizational structures

Each of you will contribute a presentation, in web form, to the rest of the class.

* Each of the following makes use of various  principles: representatives, voting, decentralized labor, etc. Make a diagram, physical visulization or other that communicates how the group organizes itself. What are the benefits and drawbacks to its structure? What are the rules? Who has a stake? What makes it special? How can we learn from it?
