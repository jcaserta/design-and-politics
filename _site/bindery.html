<p>Power dynamics are tied to organizational structures; the implicit, explicit and complicit contracts made between people within a group. The larger the group, the more likely advocacy, organizing, protest or boycotts will be warranted.</p>

<p>Using your own affiliations as content, we’ll look at how various groups organize themselves, what the benefits are to those structures, and how other organizational structures may be of value.</p>

  <blockquote>
    <p>Design an ‘org chart’ for one of the groups that you listed in class.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>Draw out the relational qualities of the humans (and potentially non-humans) within the group. Is it democratic? Is it hierarchical? How do decisions get made? Bring us into the working dynamimcs of the group using an appropriate material or form. This can be a list, a set of post-its, diagram, a physical mockup or digital outcome that communicates how the group organizes itself. What are the benefits and drawbacks to its structure? What are the rules? Who has an ownership stake? What makes it special? How can we learn from it?</p>

<p>Consider the form of the chart as it helps to reinforce the ideas you hope to convey.</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The tiger you see madly pacing its cage is [nevertheless] preoccupied with something that a human would certainly
recognize as a thought. And this thought is a question: Why? “Why, why, why, why, why, why?” the tiger asks itself hour after hour, day after day, year after year, as it treads its endless path behind the bars of its cage. It cannot analyze the question or elaborate on it. If you were somehow able to ask the creature, “Why what?” it would be unable to answer you. Nevertheless this question burns like an unquenchable flame in its mind, inflicting a searing pain that does not diminish until the creature lapses into a final lethargy that zookeepers recognize as an irreversible rejection of life. And of course this questioning is something that no tiger does in its normal habitat.</p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>To extend the metaphor from <em>Ishmael</em>, a story of a wise gorilla’s attempt to teach a young man of the consequences of the industrial age, we are the tigers and the cage is the world that has been designed: nationstates, money, global markets, media conglomerates, private ownership — the human constructs that trap our movements, limit our relationship to nature and each other, and confuse us.</p>

<p>Professor Bendik-Keymer has the best description of this:</p>

<blockquote>
  <blockquote>
    <p>The problem that divides us is neoliberalism. The system of rationality is radically simple: it subjects all values to capitalist market values, especially financial ones, thereby colonizing every aspect of life through a metric of its capacity to generate financial wealth. What makes it an especially new and pernicious form of capitalism is that it hollows out democracy and collective consciousness from within, dissolving, e.g., an awareness of class or of solidarity groupings in its radical individualization of people into their competitive potential against each other.  <a href="https://conversations.e-flux.com/t/jeremy-david-bendik-keymer-the-neoliberal-radicals/5986">In short, it destroys our capacity to think, say, and be a “we.”</a></p>
  </blockquote>
</blockquote>

<p>To be conscious is to struggle with not only what is happening around us but “how” to exit it, or improve it. We operate within layers of rules; laws and social norms. Politics is the negotiation of these rules. Politics is how those who are part of a group alter those rules.</p>

<!--

>>"We're in a moment right now where power is failing us. Care is the only thing that can save us. If we could imagine a society that privileged care over power — a society in which the highest position of status would go to the person who could care for the most people, as opposed ot the person who can accumuluate the most wealth and power—it would completely reverse our hierarchy." —Laura Shill p.14
-->

<p>If I have a thesis to offer is that the work starts to our left and to our right… that we push ourselves out of zone of comfort towards each other in solidarity to knit the human fabric again, locale by locale. Just as larger systems of racism and white privilege are being tackled, so too can the work of reknitting ourselves together with care, equity and respect in mind.</p>

<!--
Mónica Guzmán
Talking WITH people we don't understand instead of ABOUT them is the most important thing we can do for our democracy.
-->

<p>This course is my attempt to bring you in on a few areas in which I believe design mixes with politics — beyond getting people elected or the mechanics of voting. As a graduate interdisciplinary course, my intention is to frame assignments broadly, underneath units guided by an essential question. You should be able to find your place within this structure, expressing ideas in a form that make sense. In addition to three units that I’m scripting, there is time for open inquiry in the last four weeks, guests, activities and weekly news sharing from you all.</p>

<p>My work in politics has been mostly as a graphic designer helping to get progressive candidates elected. I’ve also worked on an anti-gerrymandering campaign and participated in helping to reimagine elections.</p>

<!--

Said by writer Margaret Wheatley:
“People are the solution to the problems that confront us. Relationships are all there is. We have to stop pretending individuals can go at it alone. We humans want to be together. When a community of people discovers that they share a concern, change begins.” 


“I have learned that there are no such things as monsters in this world. There are only human beings who are wounded, who do what they do out of their own sense of insecurity or anxiety or greed or blindness, and their participation in oppression comes at a cost. It cuts them off from their own capacity to love.” - Valerie Kaur

“I am convinced that men hate each other because they fear each other. They fear each other because they don’t
know each other, and they don’t know each other because they don’t communicate with each other, and they don’t
communicate with each other because they are separated from each other…”
 - Dr. Martin Luther King, Jr.
-->

<p>My goal is to bring you in to the ideas and connections that have arisen in my work in hopes to spur something more impactful in you — and to learn from you. We are all in this together. Not just in this room, but on this planet, and my hope for us is that we can thrive as a group, that we encourage each other to make work of interest to ourselves and others.</p>

<p>My optimism that we have agency to connect and build anew with each other is shared by Zoe Larkins who curated the 2020 MCA Denver exhibition titled “Citizenship: A Practice of Society.”</p>

<p>“[Citizen artists] activate and sometimes agitate the communities, political or not, of which they are members or with which they feel solidarity. They encourage others’ awareness of, engagement with, or feelings of allegiance to such communities. They expose and manipulate the forces that govern or influence them. And, often, they create entirely new forces — innovative methods of engaging with others, alternative approaches to activism, or different perspectives from which to consider an issue.” p23</p>

<!--If you strip the term citizen's exclusionary claim to democracy, if you "denationalize it", a term coined by Linda Bosniak, then you can get to what it's good for: a verb.  

Black comic Baratunde Thurston has a podcast titled "How to Citizen" who also reclaims the term to be something you "do" not something you "asire to". -->

<p>The artist Dread Scott  comments in an interview associated with the exhibition: “I encourage other artists to think about the skills they have been lucky enough to acquire through a lifetime of experience and training and put those in service of making the world better. “</p>

<p>Your stories, your vantage point of life is always an important place to start.</p>

<p>Audre Lorde quoted Simone de Beauvoir in “The Master’s Tools Will Never Dismantle the Master’s House”
“It is in the knowledge of the genuine conditions of our lives that we must draw our strength to live and our reasons for acting.”</p>

<p>One example, is the artist LaToya Ruby Frazier, who has collaborated with her mother for years to present the beauty and challenges of their lives and community in Pennsylvania.</p>

<p>Or the work of Amanda Williams who painted houses in Detroit slated for demolition. She said, “this didn’t change the neighborhood, it changed people’s perceptions about what’s possible for their neighborhood in big and small ways.”</p>

<p>Amidst the pandemic and political viscissitudes, artists and designers provide such hope, connection, release.</p>

<p>The internet has the potential to rewire power, and so I am interested in it, and would love to see digital work produced in response to the prompts given.</p>

<p>It has advantages, removing bureaucracy, hierarchies, entrenched power structures. Particularly inspiring is the work of Taiwanese Ministry of Digital Information Audrey Tang. Open Collectives, and the ability to share software.</p>

<p>We’ll talk with Gemma Copeland of Common Knowledge next week about software, coops and ways that digital technology can help rewire power.</p>

<!--
Hannah Arendt, quoted in an article by Masha Gessen in a 2020 New Yorker article: Isolation is the inability to act together with others, which, according to Arendt, is the source of a person’s political power. Isolation renders people impotent. Loneliness, Arendt posits, is the defining condition of totalitarianism and the common ground of all terror.

Design has many ways to do this. 
-->

<h3 id="unit-1-whos-in-charge">Unit 1: Who’s in charge?</h3>

<p>This course begins with the politics of small groups, organizations, associations…. By bringing awareness to your own power as a part of something. You will list organizations to which you belong, then choose one to create an org chart.</p>

<p>As a graphic designer, I’ve invested in organizations, groups, collaborations. From 2007 until 2021, I founded and nurtured a collective in downtown Providence called The Design Office. It was a 3000 sq/ft place shared workspace where individuals and groups created projects, hosted events, ran workshops.</p>

<p>This advertisement from the Blank Panther newspaper demonstrates alternative community based ways to organize around needs.</p>

<!--
Design helps through its ability to imagine, shift, change. Dunne and Raby. 

This course will look for ways in which the cultural worker can contribute as political worker. 

"Do we reinforce the divisions or do we try to tear them down."

-->

<h3 id="unit-2-how-can-we-use-symbols-to-make-a-point">Unit 2: How can we use symbols to make a point?</h3>

<p>The second unit is based around symbols. Every group or association creates a symbol to represent itself or to rally around. You will make a project that manipulates, alters or applies that symbol in order to express a viewpoint. A symbol could be a building, a piece of cloth, food, a landscape. If a symbol is reference to some shared idea, how can you appropriate it to comment on that idea?</p>

<p>Ancient Greek architecture is often faithfully used and referenced, but it can also be used symbolically, like here in Dread Scott’s proposal for what should be put in the place of a New Orleans confederate monument, a pillar that blocks a street, halting traffic and contemporary life itself.</p>

<p>The assignment asks you to choose a political symbol and to alter, apply or appropriate it to express an opinion.</p>

<p>Run through some US flag examples.</p>

<h3 id="unit-3-what-is-public-space-for">Unit 3: What is public space for?</h3>

<p>For about four weeks, we’ll focus on public things. Brown Prof. Bonnie Honig writes of the importance of public things… giving a theoretical basis for why public space and public things are important.</p>

<p>“The existence of public things — to meet each
other, to fight about, to pay for together, to enjoy, to
complain about — this is absolutely indispensable
to democratic life.”</p>

<p>She goes on to make the point that “when public things are democratized, the response of the powerful is often to abandon them.”</p>

<p>Public and unusued space allows for creative opportunities. Use it, inhabit it. Acknowledging the land was stolen opens up creative responses to calls for public art and uses of public land not for development, but to connect us to each other and greater ideas.</p>

<p>We will do a project using the public space as a starting point with the intention of connecting people, providing joy, responding to what you experience.</p>

<p>We’ll connect with the Parks Department, P3 non-profit that works in community centers and possibly a few other organizations.</p>

<p>We’ll be visited by Amber Art Collective, a BIPOC community-oriented public art group. They won a commission to paint a mural on the Garrahy Garage nearby in the Jewelry District.</p>

<p>Of particular inspiration is the work of Theaster Gates who is turning private banks and other private spaces in Chicago into community oriented creative spaces.</p>

<p>Alexandra Bell re-edits and displays newspaper stories in public to expose biases in the media. The public siting of the work makes it unmissiable…</p>

<p>As a graphic designer I’m moved by efforts of putting language into space, like this work from Zoe Leonard that starts, “I want a dyke for President. I want someone with AIDS for President, “ etc.</p>

<p>Landscapes that are not here may be inspiration for work. This image is of a nature walk at the DMZ between North and South Korea.</p>

<p>Everyday environments are fair game to co-opt.</p>

<p>The group ForFreedoms took over billboards around the U.S. and put artwork on them.</p>

<p>It’s possible to admire efforts online by Eli Pariser to create public spaces and shared conversation digitally… but I can’t help but feel skeptical of Silicon Valley’s private/non-profit solution to solving a problem.</p>

<p>The Internet is de-facto public and can be used to speak for a cause.</p>

<p>Perhaps of more interest to me is the speculative app by Miranda July called “Somebody” that uses strangers to deliver messages in person rather than over text.</p>

<h3 id="unit-4-open">Unit 4+: Open</h3>

<p>We will also talk to policians, Leonela Felix and Jean-Phillippe Barros, both are black representatives in Pawtucket. We will go to the state house to better understand how legislative change happens. This has no assignment attached to it, but like other guests and outings, may influence your own projects or better educate you on the state of voting, ballots, funding and more.  Design is the interface in which people engage with government or each other: ballots, government services, border walls, and more.</p>

<!-- 
According to State Senator Sam Bell: Good design has a huge impact on elections and advocacy campaigns.  I have also been of the view that poor design in key government systems is a meaningful impediment to effective engagement with the government.

<p>Andy Pressman of Upstatement will be here as part of the GD Spring Speaker Series. He’ll come to our class on April 7th. He’s been the creative director of Verso Books and Upstatement has designed a lot of political ephemera… We’ll use his visit to get into the advocacy, non-profit and campaign side of design.</p>

<p>Headlines. Every 3 weeks.</p>

Artists and designers are apt to help predict the future. Exhibition at the Walker:  
“The imagination creates the future,” writes Lewis Hyde, professor and author of the book The Gift: Creativity and the Artist in the Modern World.1 This explains why we think of artists—whether “fine” artists or designers—as futurists. 
http://walkerart.org/magazine/marina-gorbis-the-more-equitable-future-begins-in-the-imagination
-->

<p>Again from by Dread Scott
“All of us [those in exhibition] are making work that imagines the future in different ways or looks at how we think the world is or how it could and should be.” p15</p>

<p>We need practice expressing opinions in many different ways. Alfredo Jaar’s recent piece in Scotland. “It’s about our incapacity to change this reality, even though I keep going, I keep trying. Because this is the only thing I know”</p>

<p>We are still individuals who are best served by human contact. Let’s making things together, exemplified by this piece from Nari Ward, which I showed earlier at the MCA Deniver. He makes large-scale sculptures and installations, from unexpected materials collected around his urban neighborhood (shoelaces in this case).</p>

<p>The course should be as much about joy, play, the insertion of culture in a form that others must contend with. Rule breaking to understand why the rules are there in the first place. What are artists if not those who change the rules for those so insistent to conform to rules.</p>

			<h1 class="post-title" id="syllabus" data-slug="/2022/02/18/syllabus.html">Syllabus</h1>
			<ph2 class="post-introduction"><h1 id="design--politics">Design &amp; Politics</h1>

<p>This course explores the overlap between design and politics. The overlap is not fixed or sharp, leading the idealist and the activist alike into unknown territory. Here, politics is the means in which power is shifted. Defined as such, the designer has many ways to enter the political arena: through affecting change in small groups, organizations, neighborhoods and political office.</p>

<p>As a graduate interdisciplinary studio, the course will introduce and frame assignments in the broadest possible way to allow for many outcomes. Students are encouraged to bring their existing bodies of work, personal narratives and discipline-specific processes to their projects.</p>

<p>There will be three major assignments with a few activities, guests and outings. Some will relate and reinforce the assignments, others exist to bring students into contact with people and issues that relate to design and politics and can inform the final project.</p>

<h2 id="curriculum">Curriculum</h2>

<h3 id="units">Units</h3>

<h4 id="unit-1-whos-in-charge">Unit 1: Who’s in charge?</h4>
<p>Using your own affiliations as content, we’ll look at how various groups organize themselves, what the benefits are to those structures, and how other organizational structures may be of value.<br />
<em>2 weeks</em></p>

<h4 id="unit-2-how-can-we-use-symbols-to-make-a-point">Unit 2: How can we use symbols to make a point?</h4>
<p>Groups and movements rally behind symbols — whether a graphic symbol, a flag, a building, a color or other. You’ll be asked to choose a symbol and create a new work that alters or applies that symbol in a manner that expresses a point of view. <br />
<em>2 weeks</em></p>

<h4 id="unit-3-what-is-public-space-for">Unit 3: What is public space for?</h4>
<p>Public space provides the space for political and social acts, helping to define the culture of a place. You will make a work (or a proposal) sited in public, physical or digitaal, that encourages a shared experience. <br />
<em>4 weeks</em></p>

<h4 id="unit-4-open-inquiry">Unit 4: Open Inquiry</h4>
<p>You will have the last four weeks of class to create a work, whether individual or collaborative, that comes out of the first part of the course. <br />
<em>4 weeks</em></p>

<h4 id="weekly-news-share-and-discussion">Weekly: News share and discussion</h4>

<p>A minimum of every three weeks, you’ll share news stories of interest to you, and potentially the class. Throughout the whole semester, you shoudl be looking at news, videos, magazines, headlines, reddit posts, twitter, etc as the source for projects, commentary. Widen your sources. Use it as a chance to see how information flows and the agendas of those that propagate them. Let your imagine flow out of what you find. “Ruth Bader Ginsburg’s ashes in urn available for pets.” You may also bring up primary sources (Covid stats) as something that is news for you, worth looking more into. You may also share your personal poltical news (Ex: “my mom is for border walls, and we talked about it”).</p>

<p>These share sessions are informal, but please prepare what you plan to share in advance.</p>

<h4 id="method-activities">Method Activities</h4>

<p>You’ll work with various graphic diagramming structures  — venn diagram, slider bar, branch, border, asterick — to help generate new ideas and relationships between things.</p>

<h4 id="absences">Absences</h4>

<p>Because class activities, discussion and community-buildign is at the heart of this course, you are required to be in class, and what we do in our class meetings will help determine your learning experience and outcomes.</p>

<h4 id="method-of-instruction">Method of Instruction</h4>

<p>Class will be held in person (as long as RISD’s College Covid policies allow) and involve a mix of the following: lecture, activity, guest, outing, reviewing student work, sharing headlines, etc.</p>

<h2 id="estimated-cost-of-materials">Estimated Cost of Materials</h2>

<p>There are no mandatory expenses planned. The Graphic Design Department has a few black and white printers that can be accessed and used to print for free.</p>

<h2 id="on-subjectivity">On Subjectivity</h2>

<p>We each carry different life experiences and our goal should be to help each other see differing perspectives while the intention of making stronger work and connecting us to each other. Our viewpoints are influenced by our life experiences, education, age, identity and systemic forces out of our control. The instructor will do his best to expose students to a wide range of references and to respond to student work as generously and open-mindedly as possible. Part of how a student develops a personal voice is by seeing how the range of RISD instructors communicate their own views.</p>

<p>Particularly in a course about politics, it is expected that student viewpoints on subject matter and the reading of a work will differ. In order to grow, we must be open to listening and engaging views that we are unfamiliar with or disagree with. Please respect each others’ opinions and refrain from personal attacks or demeaning comments of any kind. Finally, remember to keep confidential all issues of a personal or professional nature that are discussed in class.</p>

<p>It is the responsibility of the individual faculty member to determine, maintain and enforce the standards of behavior acceptable to preserving an atmosphere appropriate for teaching and learning.</p>

<h2 id="community-guidelines">Community Guidelines</h2>

<ol>
  <li>Listen actively and share the floor. Allow others to speak if you have already spoken, and try to speak up if you tend to be an observer.</li>
  <li>It is OK to disagree, but not OK to shame, blame, or attack another person.</li>
  <li>Assume positive intent on the part of fellow participants.</li>
  <li>Ask questions from a standpoint of curiosity, as opposed to arguing or debating a point of view.</li>
  <li>Use I statements when sharing experiences, feelings and opinions. I feel, I believe, I think, …</li>
  <li>Avoid making generalizations. Facts and evidence are important.</li>
  <li>Allow space for emotions to be expressed, and notice when you get emotional. Ask yourself, what are your emotions teaching you?</li>
  <li>Be conscientious about your use of slurs against any identity group, even when telling a story or quoting. Choose your words thoughtfully. Some words open doors while others slam them shut.</li>
  <li>Address others using the name, pronouns, and identifying language they request.</li>
  <li>Privacy: please do not share other peoples stories outside of the group. If a story must be shared ask the storytellers permission first and ask them how our planet can be shared.</li>
</ol>

<p><a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1ciHcgNzB_pfTMVNWd-X9epU9ZA5l27QBw4MvKRNVP7k/edit?usp=sharing">Refer and alter the community guidelines</a></p>

<h2 id="academic-misconduct">Academic Misconduct</h2>

<p>All work is built upon other work; whether explicitly or not. In this course, there will be opportunities to work with your classmates to build something that is shared. Particularly with many deadlines and when learning a new skill, other people’s work may offer a pathway forward. What you do with what you see is important and can be the difference between riffing, appropriating, copying and stealing. As a general rule of thumb, if you see something you are excited about (in class or outside), understand the context in which it was made. What was the design responding to, communicating, and to whom. A deeper understanding of other people’s work generally produces additional ideas, realizations and starts to “fork” the idea (thank you, Github). It’s rare that your design problem is exactly like someone else’s. It is rare that you share the same values, interests, skills, as someone else. Referencing another person’s work can make sense (logo parodies, etc) if that fits your concept. In a school environment it’s best to check in with your teacher to see how to best make your own work truly your own.</p>

<p>We expect all GD students and faculty to maintain an open perspective towards these concepts, and to use class as a safe testing ground for exploring influence, with the guidance of faculty. For more information, please see <a href="https://docs.google.com/document/d/1fhrz5BwCbLFpX3iisUD8h1FgZFmSxkgRIkxvvJ4AzHs">“It’s probably not plagiarism,”</a> along with RISD’s Academic Code of Conduct.</p>

<h2 id="disability-statement">Disability Statement</h2>

<p>RISD is committed to providing equal opportunity for all students. If you are a student with a disability that may require accommodations to complete the requirements of this class, I encourage you to discuss your learning needs with me during the first week of the term. Once an approval letter from the Office of Disability Support Services is submitted, accommodations will be provided as needed. For more information on how to receive accommodations, please contact Disability Support Services at 401-709-8460 or disabilitysupportservices@risd.edu.</p>

<h3 id="land-acknowledgment-">Land acknowledgment *</h3>

<p>Rhode Island School of Design is built on what is now called College Hill, part of the ancestral homelands of the Narragansett Nation, the only federally recognized tribe in Rhode Island. Indigenous people from many nations—near and far—live, study and work in Providence today. RISD community members are committed to actively addressing the many violent legacies of colonialism in our daily work. The amplification of Native voices and histories is crucial to rectifying the destructive past, and we gratefully acknowledge the ongoing critical contributions of Indigenous people across our state, region and nation.
Let us commit ourselves as designers and human beings and with our work to create more equitable, respectful and honest open cultures and societies.</p>

<p><em>*This text has been sent to Anthony D. Stanton, chief sachem of the Narragansett Nation, to ask for his review. The text will be revised to address any feedback RISD receives from Chief Stanton or from one of his representatives.</em></p>
