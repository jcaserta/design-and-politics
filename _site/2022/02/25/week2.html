<em>45min</em></p>

<p>Just following the current events debrief, we’ll look at what questions you came up with in Slack for Gemma.</p>

<h2 id="conversation-with-gemma-copeland">Conversation with Gemma Copeland</h2>

<p>On your own when not in small groups reviewing the org charts, read the resources provided to prepare for Gemma Copeland in the <a href="/2022/02/18/unit1.html#week2">Week 2</a> section of the Unit 1 brief. Use this time to also look at the readings and references in the Unit 1 brief. Come up with three questions you want to ask at our 5pm Zoom. Place those in Slack under #guests</p>

<h5 id="500">5:00</h5>

<p>Same Zoom link for conversation <br />
<em>55min</em></p>

<h5 id="555">5:55</h5>

<p>Take five minutes to reflect on the conversation. What is one revelation that derived itself from the conversation? John will drop a Google Doc link in the Zoom chat where you can share with the rest of the class. <br />
<em>5min</em></p>
