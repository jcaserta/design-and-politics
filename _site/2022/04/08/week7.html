<p>We’ll talk with Andy Pressman about his experiences with design and politics as a community organizer, designer and now creative director at Upstatement. <em>Above: His design system for Democratic Socialists for America played out by local chapters</em></p>

<h2 id="public-space-check-in">Public space check-in</h2>

<h5 id="210">2:10</h5>

<p>Assembled in a group of three, discuss the locaion you’ve chosen for your public space project and get feedback from your classmates. Drop images of your site in the #unit-3 channel in Slack for John to see.</p>

<h4 id="readingreference">Reading/Reference</h4>

<ul>
  <li>Harvard Design Magazine’s issue on Publics is scanned by article and <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/folders/1TO68onmzshzOJujMNQm9qtWPrQFd-lC1?usp=sharing">viewable here</a>. It includes articles on equity, protest, etc. Particularly impactful is this interview with Walter Hood asking <a href="https://drive.google.com/drive/u/1/folders/1TO68onmzshzOJujMNQm9qtWPrQFd-lC1">“How can we share space together.”</a></li>
</ul>

<h4 id="method-activity-extremismsliders">Method activity: Extremism/Sliders</h4>

<p>For next week, work with the form of the slider bar. Slider bars have a range between a minimum and a maximum. Create a minimum of 20 slider bars for various scenarios. Define the minimum and maximum as a way to stretch how we think about those scenarios.</p>

<p>Show us results from your slider bar activity as a way of stretching your conception about what you can do in your site.</p>

<h2 id="outdoor-activity">Outdoor activity</h2>

<p><img src="/img/arrow.jpg" alt="Arrow made from moss" /></p>

<p>We’ll venture out to two contiguious public parks: Mary Elizabeth Sharpe, which occupies two house plots between Benefit and Pratt Streets, and Prospect Terrace Park, which abutts ME Sharpe.</p>

<p>You’ll work in groups of three. As a means of investing and participating in public space, make a short-term alteration to the park. Use what you find, and reconfigure it to communicate with other visitors.</p>
